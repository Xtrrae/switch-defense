# lights out!
this game was made for [Campfire Flagship](https://flagship.hackclub.com). it's so peak.

# the premise
you're a light switch and your goal is to turn off some lights. when these lights turn off, however, they explode. obviously, these light bulbs don't want to explode. think about so they rush you in an attempt to attack. 

in order to turn off these lights and make them explode, you must set your switches to the specific combinations above the bulb's head. **zero indicates off. one indicates on.**

# controls

you're given a light switch to plug into your computer. if you don't have a light switch, you may press the keys 1-4 (not keypad) to indicate ON for that specific switch. the game and difficult was designed around the light switch and it may get too easy if you're using a keyboard.

# points, levels, health and combos

- you get points for entering correct combinations to defeat light bulbs.
- the more light bulbs you defeat, the higher your level. this game gets more difficult as you increase in level.
- if you're able to get a lot of light bulbs in a short period of time, you'll see a combo marker.
- if a light bulb is able to reach you, you take damage to your health. once your health becomes zero, the game is over.
